# MorseKeyboard

The plan is for this to be a super simple Morse code input method for Android devices with tiny screens.

The first target device will be the KingWear KW88 Android watch. It's cheap, works well enough, but has a garbage keyboard.

* There are no good keyboards for Android watches
* There are no good Morse code input methods on Android in general (At least not that match the realities of high speed code input.)

So, this should fit the bill... if I ever get time to finish it.

As a note: I don't care about perfect code for this project.
